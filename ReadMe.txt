Certainly! Here are the instructions to start the server in English:

**Instructions to Start the Server**

Once you've cloned the repository (i.e., downloaded a copy of the project's source code to your computer), follow the steps below to start the server:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory (folder) where you cloned the repository using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is located in a folder named "my-project," use the following command:

   ```
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Once you're in your project directory, execute the following command to install all the project's necessary dependencies (the "packages"):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required packages for the project. Wait for the download and installation process to complete.

4. Once all the dependencies have been successfully installed, you can start the server using the following command:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This command will launch your server, and it will be ready to handle incoming requests.

That's it! Your project's server should now be up and running, ready for use. You can access your application through a web browser or by using other project-specific methods.
